# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the process of designing,developing,testing,coding,maintenance and evaluation of software system.
software engineering helps in the following.
It helps in reducing comlexity
it allows managing of time hence the progects are reduced within the deadlines.
it enhances technological innovations hence new application.
it allows rellibility and quality.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
in  the early times first computers required the first software programs which were writen in machine code.
software crisis which led to introduction of structure and programing to improve code relliability.
object orientedprogramming.
Agile methodologies.
modern era.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning and analysis.its conducted to ensure understanding of what is needed to be developed.
Requirements defination.in this phase the gathered information is translated into detailed requirements.
design,such as data models and system interfaces.
Development of the actual coding of software takes place in this phase.
Testing.
deployment.this phase includes training of the users and documentation.
maintenance.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall has rigid structure,sequential process and its applicable in building of hospitals whereas agile methodology has interative process ,flexible stucture and customer feedback .its applicable in in sofware development such as making mobile apps.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.software developer.
he or she should test and debugg the software to ensure it meets user requirements.
should stay updated to ensure continouse improvement of latest industry trends.
2.Quality assurance engineer.
should be able to test sofware spesifications and execute fuctionality.
should check on regression testing and test planning.
3.project manager.
should ensure risk and team managment among the team members.
should ensure good communication between the stakeholders of the whole team.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Importance of IDEs.
it enhances debugging and testing.
it enhaces productivity and project management.
example, it used in visual aid to support many programming language and windows applications
         used in anroid studio.
Importance of VCs.
it helps developers to retrive the previous work hence no work is losed.
it helps to no the history of a project evolution.
example,mercurial and git.
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Chaleges faced .
rapid advancement of technology can be overwhelming hence developers should be continous learning and communicating to know the updates.
frequent changes in project development.
time constraits. provide time to allow execution of programs before the deadline.
limited resoursces to facilitate the software development. the provided resources should be used accordingly to a specific task .
Security threats. adresses should be provided and regular updates of edited to the coding to prevent this threat.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing.this is testing each and every point hence it ensures correct working making improved quality of the system.
integration testing.this testing allows the interalation between componets to ensure good working.helps to identify issues that may rise during the combination.
acceptance testing. it is performed to check wheather the system is ready as the user interface.it allows the deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering.
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the process of desingning and refining prompts to guide generative AI models in producing desired output.
importance.
used to solve generative text and complex problems.
it improves accuracy.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague promt are , write a story , talks about history, leading to wide range of responses .
improved prompt,it gives a summary of a whole story and a clear text.
